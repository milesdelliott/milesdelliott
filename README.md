Full-stack engineer with 9+ years of experience building data
visualization tools and web applications. I have a Graphic Design
background and six years in ad tech—creating dashboards, analytics
interfaces, and publisher tools running on 60,000+ sites.

I care about making complex data accessible, writing clean code, and
shipping work that delivers results.
